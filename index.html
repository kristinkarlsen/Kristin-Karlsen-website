                <p>I currently own and operate my own small business, specializing in website design for costumers.
                    Throughout my academic career, my passion for web design has been a recurring theme, inspiring me to
                    further educate myself in this field. By combining what i learned at school with experimenting on my own, watching tutorial
                    videos, and seeking guidance from knowledgeable professors and experienced web developers, I have
                    acquired crucial skills and expertise as a web designer.
                    <br><br/>
                    I became interested in web design when I was a high school student at Stangnes VGS studying media
                    and communication. I co-founded a photography company with a few of my classmates as a class
                    project, and I was in charge of designing and building the website. I learned how to create websites
                    using tools like WordPress and Elementor throughout the process, as well as how to grasp domains and
                    web hosting.

                        I'm now doing a bachelor's degree at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania in marketing and brand management.
                        I've
                        learned a lot from this programme about user behavior, sales, customer psychology, customer
                        journey
                        mapping, and successful communication. Additionally, I have developed skills in putting SEO
                        approaches into practice, enhancing digital visibility, and creating successful marketing plans.
                        <br><br/>
                        At the University of Queensland, I also got the chance to take part in a study abroad program
                        where I expanded my knowledge of graphic design and website development. I improved my
                        Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator capabilities through the Visual Information course. And I
                        developed abilities in VS Code, HTML, CSS, JS, and Figma thanks to the Introduction to
                        Web Design course. The main assignment of the course was to design a website and utilize HTML, CSS, and JS to
                        build it, <strong>which led to the creation of this website, kristinkarlsen.com.</strong>
